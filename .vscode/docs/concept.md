# Atlas of the Soul — Concept
A narrative reflection app: users journey through seven “soul-cities.”
- Emotion (Heartlands) • Passion (Ember Quarter) • Intellect (Glass Halls)
- Willpower (Forge) • Memory (Echo Vaults) • Imagination (Dreamfields) • Silence (Stillpoint)

Principles:
- Pilgrimage, not points/streaks.
- Sensors enrich, never gate; always opt-in.
- Reflection → Action → Integration (each quest ties inner insight to an outer step).

Core loop:
1) Open app → river greeting
2) Get daily quest (reflection/action/release/sensor)
3) Complete → Atlas lights a city / adds an artifact (torch/ripple/stone/lantern/tree/shard)
4) 21 days → all seven cities lit → deeper “hidden districts” unlock
